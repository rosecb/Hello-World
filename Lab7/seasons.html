Cold, rainy, windy afternoons with cool grey skies. Friends bundling up with sweaters and hoodies. Coming home after being outside in the pouring rain and cold winds.

Hanging out with friends more often and taking pictures for memories. Having bbq’s in the afternoon. Going to the mainland, and walking around the city looking at shops. Having lunch at cafes or restaurants. Doing artsy things around the city. Walking and exploring during late nights. Pastel colors appearing everywhere in clothing and foods.");

Having smoothies and fruit drinks. Just having memories of relaxing and being stress free. The moon starts to go down much later, when the weather begins to get hotter. Going to the beach to tan more. Spending time in the AC after a super hot day. Taking the time to learn a new skill. Eating so much fruits and spending time with friends more often.

But in Hawaii, it’s another story, where we do still do summer things in September and October. Hanging out with friends after school trying new foods and drinks that came out. Watching the sunset light up with warm colors. Red, orange, yellow sunsets. Getting adjusted to the new school year and classes. Watching movies with friends.");
